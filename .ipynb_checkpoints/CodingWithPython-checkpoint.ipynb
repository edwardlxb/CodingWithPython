    "I chose the [Machine Learning with scikit-learn](http://amueller.github.io/sklearn_tutorial/#/) article. The article and code are using sklearn package to create a machine learning model to detect insults in Social commentary. This is interesting to me because it taught me the workflow of creating a machine learning program, such as classficiation methods, clustering, and regression. \n",
