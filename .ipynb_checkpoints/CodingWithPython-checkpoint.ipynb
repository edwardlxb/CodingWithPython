    "I chose the [Machine Learning with scikit-learn](http://amueller.github.io/sklearn_tutorial/#/) article. The article and code are using sklearn package to create a machine learning model to detect insults in Social commentary. This is interesting to me because it taught me the workflow of creating a machine learning program, such as classficiation methods, clustering, and regression. \n",

    "\n",
    "* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) provides advanced math functions and data structures.\n",
    "* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) provides ploting functions to data visualizations\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q2 You’ll often want to do the same things in python that you do in R, but the packages are not the same. So you’ll use similar, but not identical, libraries. Find and link a library that serves the same or a similar purpose as ggplot does for R.**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is similar to ggplot for R. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3 You’ll also want to work with data in a format similar to what we’ve become used to: things like dataframes. Go find a python library for data analysis that uses something like dataframes. Link it here!**\n",

    "* Functions. R needs *{}* to wrap the function, while python doesn't\n",
    "* Basic functions. R mainly uses function() to execute functions in a package, but python uses a dot, for example, df.index"
